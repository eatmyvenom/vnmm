<h3> What do I do </h3>
<div>
Well I play quite a bit on minecraft tbh. When I am not doing that I am doing linux stuff. 
This stuff is something I do as a hobby. Any real linux user knows that me saying "Linux 
stuff" is nearly meaningless. The same applies to minecraft users so I will expand on that.

<h4>
Minecraft

<div>
Most recently you can find me on party games on hypixel. I have 702 wins between all of my 
accounts at the moment. I hangout with alot of those people in the community generally.
I have a page that will have a list of the top party games players updated kinda regularly.

Aside from hypixel minigames I am a very inactive part of the technical minecraft community.
The servers I have been a member of so far are Mechanists, and Hekate. However more
recently I have been hanging out with the scicraft crew. My place in the community was
a code digger. What that meant was to go in the minecraft code and read it and find out as
much as possible. I also did some extremely light modding while I was there. I currently
maintain a mod called <a href="https://github.com/eatmyvenom/litematica-printer">litematica printer</a>.

Most recently I spent some work packaging some useful tech mods. The author Masa offered me
some help with this process and now there are AUR packages for his mods availible. This was
an important effort due to the fact that his mods specifically are alot of effort to update.
Now that there is a way to get these mods via a package its far more easy to use and update
his mods!
